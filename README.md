## üîå Network communication

The following image demonstrates the request paths in a local development environment.

API and WEB requests sent by the browser are proxied directly via published ports to the running server instances.

But the SSR request is sent by the node server, not the browser, and should be sent directly to the host of the API docker service.

For production environment it is recommended to configure a Reverse Proxy Server that will handle all incoming requests.
